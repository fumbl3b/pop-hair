# Fixing Vercel Deployment Issues

If you encounter a 404 error when deploying your static site to Vercel, follow these updated steps:

## Step 1: Make sure your project structure is correct

Your project should have:
- `index.html` in the root directory
- All assets in the appropriate folders (css, js, images, etc.)

## Step 2: Update vercel.json

Replace your vercel.json with this configuration:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": false,
  "outputDirectory": ".",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ],
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "trailingSlash": false
}
```

This configuration:
- Skips any build step with `"buildCommand": false`
- Sets the output directory to the current folder with `"outputDirectory": "."`
- Adds a rewrite rule to serve index.html for all routes
- Enables clean URLs (removes .html extensions)
- Disables trailing slashes

## Step 3: Add package.json

Create a basic package.json file:

```json
{
  "name": "pop-hair-salon",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Pop Hair Salon website",
  "main": "index.html",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "npx serve"
  },
  "author": "Pop Hair Salon",
  "license": "UNLICENSED"
}
```

This helps Vercel identify your project as a Node.js project, which can be helpful for static sites.

## Step 4: Re-deploy

1. Commit these changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Redeploy on Vercel (or it will automatically deploy if you've set up continuous deployment)

## Step 5: Verify deployment

Visit your Vercel URL to check if the site is now loading correctly. The changes we made ensure that:

1. No build process is attempted
2. The files are served directly from your repository
3. All routes redirect to index.html, which is needed for single-page applications

If you're still having issues, try these troubleshooting steps:

1. Check Vercel's deployment logs for specific errors
2. Ensure all file paths in your HTML, CSS, and JS are relative, not absolute
3. Try deploying a simplified version first (just an index.html) to isolate the issue
